## Quick Start


## 3.1 CI Pipeline Overview
The approach to building a CI pipeline for a machine-learning project can vary depending on the workflow of each company. In this project, we will create one of the most common workflows to build a CI pipeline:

Data scientists make changes to the code.
Data scientists push the changes to GitHub or another remote storage.
Data scientists create a pull request for the changes.
A CI pipeline is triggered to test the code.
If changes are approved, they are merged into the main branch.
